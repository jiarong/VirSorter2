            fields in semicolon-delimited-string:
            [0]ID: A unique identifier for each gene, consisting of the ordinal ID of the sequence and an ordinal ID of that gene within the sequence (separated by an underscore). For example, "4_1023" indicates the 1023rd gene in the 4th sequence in the file.
            [1]partial: An indicator of if a gene runs off the edge of a sequence or into a gap. A "0" indicates the gene has a true boundary (a start or a stop), whereas a "1" indicates the gene is "unfinished" at that edge (i.e. a partial gene). For example, "01" means a gene is partial at the right boundary, "11" indicates both edges are incomplete, and "00" indicates a complete gene with a start and stop codon.
            [2]start_type: The sequence of the start codon (usually ATG, GTG, or TTG). If the gene has no start codon, this field will be labeled "Edge".
            [3]rbs_motif: The RBS motif found by Prodigal (e.g. "AGGA" or "GGA", etc.)
            [4]rbs_spacer: The number of bases between the start codon and the observed motif.
            [5]gc_cont: The GC content of the gene sequence.
            [6]conf: A confidence score for this gene, representing the probability that this gene is real, i.e. 78.3% means Prodigal believes that gene is real 78.3% of the time and a false positive 21.7% of the time.
            [7]score: The total score for this gene.
            [8]cscore: The hexamer coding portion of the score, i.e. how much this gene looks like a true protein.
            [9]sscore: A score for the translation initiation site for this gene; it is the sum of the following three fields.
            [10]rscore: A score for the RBS motif of this gene.
            [11]uscore: A score for the sequence surrounding the start codon.
            [12]tscore: A score for the start codon type (ATG vs. GTG vs. TTG vs. Nonstandard).
